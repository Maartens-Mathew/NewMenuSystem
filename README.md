# NewMenuSystem

A WPF-based food and drinks menu ordering system designed for restaurants, built with C#, XAML, and the MVVM architectural pattern.

## Project Overview

**NewMenuSystem** is a desktop application intended for waitrons to capture and manage customer orders on a device. This project represents a personal learning milestone, functioning as my first solo development effort in C# and WPF, and provided hands-on experience with architectural layering and the MVVM pattern.

Key goals and features:
- Device-based order entry for food and drinks
- UI crafted with WPF and XAML for a modern desktop experience
- MVVM structure enabling separation of concerns and maintainability
- Microsoft Access database connectivity

Although the application did not progress beyond initial features, it remains a complete example of an MVVM-patterned, data-driven WPF application.

## Features

- **Menu and Order Capture:** Interfaces dedicated for ordering and managing existing orders.
- **Waitron Selector:** UI portion allowing staff selection and order allocation.
- **Navigation:** Simple modular structure, using navigation classes, to decouple different forms and functionalities.
- **Styling:** Custom themes for menu buttons and core UI elements.
- **Database Access:** Connection and read/write support for a Microsoft Access database.

## Technology Stack

- **Language:** C#
- **UI Framework:** WPF with XAML
- **Architecture:** MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
- **Database:** Microsoft Access

- Most business and UI logic is separated into `Forms` and `MVVM` directories.
- Reusable styles are placed in `Themes/MenuButtonTheme.xaml`.
- The `Properties` folder contains project configuration and resource files.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Maartens-Mathew/NewMenuSystem.git
   ```

2. **Requirements:**
   - Visual Studio 2017+ (with .NET desktop development workload)
   - Microsoft Access (for database file, not bundled in repo)

3. **Build & Run:**
   - Open `TestApp.sln` in Visual Studio.
   - Restore NuGet packages (if needed), then build and run the project.

4. **Database Configuration:**
   - Ensure an Access database with the required schema is present and the connection string in `App.config` is updated.
